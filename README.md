There is also explicit colors variables that can be customized:

* aqua
* aqua-bg
* green
* green-bg
* green-bg-s
* cyan
* red
* red-bg
* red-bg-s
* blue
* blue-bg
* blue-bg-s
* magenta
* yellow
* yellow-bg

The `green` and `red` colors have two background versions. The `green-bg` and  `red-bg` are normal light background colors.
The `green-bg-s`, `red-bg-s`, and `blue-bg-s` are a stronger version and are used in `ediff` and places were text is added, deleted or changed.

If you are using [humanoid](https://github.com/syl20bnr/humanoid), you can put this snippet in your `dothumanoid/user-init` to override these colors:

```elisp
  (custom-set-variables '(humanoid-custom-colors
                          '((act1 . "#ff0000")
                            (act2 . "#0000ff")
                            (base . "#ffffff"))))
```

This will override `act1`, `act1` and `base` to use the specified colors.
